                <h1>Hidan</h1>
                <p>Hidan was a missing ninja from Yugakure, who joined the Akatsuki and teamed up with Kakuzu. Kisame
                    called the two of them were called the Zombie Duo, as they were almost unkillable.<br>

                    Hidan was immortal and used the blood of his opponent to subdue and kill them. His immortality made
                    it very difficult to fight him; however, despite his immortality, Hidan didn't make the most of it.
                    He was eventually defeated by Shikamaru Nara.<br>

                    Strongest Ability and Biggest Feat: Hidan was extremely proud of his inability to die, and he would
                    often charge head-first into situations. Hidan's most powerful ability was the Curse Technique:
                    Death Controlling Possessed Blood. Hidan used this technique to take control of Asuma's body,
                    ultimately killing the Hidden Leaf Jonin.</p>
