                <h1>Deidara</h1>
                <p>Deidara was the youngest member of the Akatsuki. Initially, he wasn't ready to join the group, but
                    Itachi defeated him and forced him to join the organization.<br>
                    Deidara was a proficient user of Explosion Release. With his special molding clay, he could create
                    all kinds of shapes. Deidara also created a way to bypass the genjutsu of the Sharingan. His
                    rashness limited his thinking capability and stalled his growth as a fighter.<br>

                    Strongest Ability and Biggest Feat: There was a reason why the Akatsuki sought out Deidara. His
                    talent to create different kinds of bombs was unparalleled. Deidara's strongest technique was C0. He
                    used it as a final resort in his fight with Sasuke, and he almost managed to kill Uchiha, who
                    narrowly escaped due to his quick thinking.</p>
